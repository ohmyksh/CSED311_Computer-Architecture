[ POSTECH 2023 Spring Computer Architecture  ]   
Computer architecture is the science and art of selecting and interconnecting hardware components to create a computer that meets functional, performance, and cost goals. This course introduces the basic principles and hardware structures of a modern general-purpose computer. We will learn, for example, how to design the control and datapath for a pipelined RISC processor and how to design fast memory and storage systems. The principles presented in the lectures are reinforced in the laboratory through designing and implementing a RISC processor in Register Transfer-Level (RTL) using Verilog HDL.   

We did the Lab assignments given in the class together as a group of two.    

Lab1. RTL Design  
Lab2. Single Cycle CPU  
Lab3. Multi Cycle CPU  
Lab 4-1. pipelined CPU without control  
Lab 4-2. pipelined CPU with control flow instr  
Lab 5. Cache
