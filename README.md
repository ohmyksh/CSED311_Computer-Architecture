**POSTECH 2023 Spring â€“ Computer Architecture**  
Computer architecture is the science and art of selecting and interconnecting hardware components to create a computer that meets functional, performance, and cost goals. This course introduces the basic principles and hardware structures of a modern general-purpose computer. We will learn, for example, how to design the control and datapath for a pipelined RISC processor and how to design fast memory and storage systems. The principles presented in the lectures are reinforced in the laboratory through designing and implementing a RISC processor in Register Transfer-Level (RTL) using Verilog HDL.   

The following labs were completed as a group of two during the course:

| **Lab**        | **Description**                            |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Lab 1**      | RTL Design                                 |
| **Lab 2**      | Single Cycle CPU                           |
| **Lab 3**      | Multi Cycle CPU                            |
| **Lab 4-1**    | Pipelined CPU without control              |
| **Lab 4-2**    | Pipelined CPU with control flow instructions|
| **Lab 5**      | Cache                                      |
